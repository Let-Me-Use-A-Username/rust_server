Two choices exist for database connection:

    1) Connection per request
        +Resource efficient
        -Request overhead

    2) Persistent connection
        +Performance
        -Resource consumption

    3) Pooling
        Middle ground between the two.
        Keep a connection pool and when a transaction takes place,
        borrow a connection and when done return it.
        Needs research.
