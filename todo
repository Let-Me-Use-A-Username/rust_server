=========TODO===========
Server side:
    -Make better responses
    -When user logs in, check session to see if expired
    -Validate session integrity (Research)

Client side:
    -Check if session works correctly
    -Research on better redirect method
    -Save cookie 
    -On login, send user cookie (if exists) to server.                                                                     
    -After login , redirect user to homepage.                                                                            
    -Sign in as guest and serve temporary cookie. 
    -Popup (alert) not showing on mobile devices




===========NOTES===========
Cookies and Sessions:
    -Check if used id (Uuid) generated already exists in database (collision).
    -Sessions are valid for one hour.
    -Cookies are deleted when the sessions ends, either via browser or via expiration.


Database:
    Two choices exist for database connection:

        1) Connection per request
            +Resource efficient
            -Request overhead

        2) Persistent connection
            +Performance
            -Resource consumption

        3) Pooling
            Middle ground between the two.
            Keep a connection pool and when a transaction takes place,
            borrow a connection and when done return it.
            Needs research.
