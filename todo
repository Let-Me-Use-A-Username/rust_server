=========TODO===========
Server side:
    -Check if cookie is server correctly (main)
    -Check if session works correctly (credentials)
        -If served save to database
        -If validating, check against database
        


Client side:
    -Check if session works correctly 
                                                                                                                      
    -Sign in as guest and serve temporary cookie. 
    -Popup (alert) not showing on mobile devices



===========BETTER IMPLEMENTATION===========
Server side:
    -Make better responses
    -B64Encoder retries to hash with half the bytes

Client side:
    -Research on better redirect method


===========NOTES===========
Cookies and Sessions:
    -Check if user id (Uuid) generated already exists in database (collision).
    -Sessions are valid for one hour.
    -Cookies are deleted when the sessions ends, either via browser or via expiration.


Database:
    Two choices exist for database connection:

        1) Connection per request
            +Resource efficient
            -Request overhead

        2) Persistent connection
            +Performance
            -Resource consumption

        3) Pooling
            Middle ground between the two.
            Keep a connection pool and when a transaction takes place,
            borrow a connection and when done return it.
            Needs research.
