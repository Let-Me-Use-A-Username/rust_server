=========TODO===========
Server side:
    Cookies and Sessions:
        -Check if user id (Uuid) generated already exists in database (collision).


Client side:                                                                            
    -Sign in as guest and serve temporary cookie.
        Server side:
            -Guest users will be saved on a different database.
                -Either in memory or physical
            -Create passive scripts that drop guest session on some iterval (once a day?)

    -Popup (alert) not showing on mobile devices



===========BETTER IMPLEMENTATION===========
Server side:
    -Make better responses
    -B64Encoder retries to hash with half the bytes

Client side:
    -Research on better redirect method
