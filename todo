===========BETTER IMPLEMENTATION===========

===========NOTES===========
Server side:
    Session and User in database:
        -Before inserting to database, it is checked to see whether the ids already exists (Uuid collision)
    Guest Users:
        -Due to the low memory on the VPS, an additional and separate table will be used, instead of a separate database, cause no memory.
